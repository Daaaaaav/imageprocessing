# Image Processing and Recognition

## Project Description
This project, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Daaaaaav/imageprocessing), is a web-based image processing and recognition tool that provides users with various functionalities to manipulate, analyze, and enhance images. The system is built using a Python backend and a frontend developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly interface. It aims to simplify image processing tasks for educational, research, and practical applications.

## Features
The system offers various image processing functionalities, including:
- **Greyscale Conversion** – Converts color images to grayscale.
- **Negative Transformation** – Inverts pixel values to create a negative effect.
- **Color Manipulation** – Adjusts image colors, hues, and saturation.
- **Flip Operations** – Horizontal and vertical flipping.
- **Translation** – Moves the image in specified directions.
- **Scaling** – Resizes images with upscaling and downscaling options.
- **Rotation** – Rotates images by a user-defined angle.
- **Cropping** – Extracts a specific portion of an image.
- **Image Blending** – Merges two images with adjustable transparency.
- **Brightness & Contrast Adjustments** – Enhances image brightness and contrast.
- **Color Filtering** – Retains or emphasizes specific colors.
- **Border and Padding Addition** – Adds customizable borders to images.
- **Image Overlay** – Places one image over another.

## Installation Guide
